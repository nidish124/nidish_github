    "Who ever has come to New York will be enchanted by her beauty and atmosphere, with vibrant life 24/7, never-ending to-do list, booming business at every corners, and by the expertly-planned transport system which can take you everywhere in the city.\n",
    "New York is famous worldwide as the finance center and the \"tourist must go to\" city in North America. No wonder the real estate market there is one of the priciest. It's where a penthouse at the new Peter Marino-designed condo The Getty, just steps from the High Line, is sold for \\\\$59 million (\\\\$5,826/ft2).\n",
    "But that is just an outlier example. A quick search can show us the real estate price can vary by a large margin from neighborhoods to neighborhoods. For example, a 2-bedrooms condo in Central Park West, Upper West Side can cost \\$4.91 millions on average; while in Inwood, Upper Manhattan, just 30 minutes aways, it's only \\\\$498 thousands.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what aspects of a neighborhood that can effect the price of real estates to such extend? One hypothesis is that the surrounding venues can be a decision factor.\n",
    "Surely anyone, who has attempted to find an accommodation for rent or buy, has seen advertisements such as: This condo is located near the subway station, malls, supermarkets, dinners, etc. And it's likely that the price will be higher than others with locations not as \"convenient\".\n",
    "Can the venues surrounding an accommodation effect its price? And what kind of venues can effect the most? And by what weight?"

    "  * if we can use the surrounding venue to estimate the value of an accommodation over the average price of one area? And to what degree of confidence?  \n",
    "The result can be useful for home buyers, who can roughly estimate the value of a target house over the average.\n",
    "Or to planners, who can decide which venues to place around their product, so that the price is maximized.\n",
    "Or to just any normal person"
